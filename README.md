# Avalanche-Clone

Project in [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) C. Based on the web game [Avalanche](https://freegames.org/avalanche/)

Made this project just to test Raylib. Play the original it is great!

## How to run

Compile the file by running `make` in the base directory.

Should produce a binary file in bin named build_osx. Run binary with `./bin/build_osx`.

Make command builds for OSX. If running on another platform you will have to configure the build differently.
